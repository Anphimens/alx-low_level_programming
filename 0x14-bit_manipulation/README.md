# Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is the process of applying logical operations on a sequence of bits to achieve result.

### General
 - In this project the learner is tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks herself to meet with the learning objectives.

## Requirments
 - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
 - All your files will be compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
 - All files should end with a new line
 - Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
 - The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
 - The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`

### `` header file ``
 `main.h` contains all the prototypes of the functions used int the bit manipulation project. The header file is include guarded
