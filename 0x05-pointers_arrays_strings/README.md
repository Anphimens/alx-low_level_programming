# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Pointers
Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They allow indirect access to data by pointing to the memory location where the data is stored. In simpler terms, a pointer "points" to a specific location in memory.

## Arrays
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. It provides a way to store and access multiple values of the same type under a single variable name.

## Strings
Strings are sequences of characters represented as arrays of characters. A string is a collection of characters terminated by a null character ('\0'), which marks the end of the string.


## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), **without the help of Google**:

### General

 - What are pointers and how to use them
 - What are arrays and how to use them
 - What are the differences between pointers and arrays
 - How to use strings and how to manipulate them
 - Scope of variables

## Requirements

### General
 - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
 - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
 - All your files should end with a new line
 - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
 - Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
 - You are not allowed to use global variables
 - No more than 5 functions per file
 - You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden
 - You are allowed to use `_putchar`
 - The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`

## Tasks

**Task 0 - 98 Battery st**

``
Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98
``

**Task 1 -  Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**

``
Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
``

**Task 2 - Collaboration is multiplication**

``Write a function that multiplies two integers.
``

**Task 3 - The numbers speak for themselves**

``
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
``

**Task 4 - I believe in numbers and signs**

``
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
``

**Task 5 - Numbers constitute the only universal language**

``
Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
``

**Task 6 - The shortest distance between two points is a straight line**

``
Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
``

**Task 7 - I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe**

``
Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
``

**Task 8 - You are so much sunshine in every square inch**

``
Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
``

**Task 9 -  Fizz-Buzz**

```
The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
```

**Task 10 - Triangles**

``
Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
``

**Task 11 -  The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic**

```
The prime factors of 1231952 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 37 and 2081.
Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.
```

**Task 12 - Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper**

``
Write a function that prints an integer.
``
