## C - DOUBLY LINKED LISTS
A doubly linked list is a type of data structure. It's similar to a singly linked list, but with an additional link (or pointer) that allows traversal in both directions: `forwards and backwards`.

** Each element in a doubly linked list contains three fields: **
```
1. Data: This field holds the actual value or data of the element.
2. Previous Pointer: This pointer points to the previous element in the list, allowing you to traverse the list in reerse order.
3. Next Pointer: This pointer points to the element in the list, allowing you to traverse the list in the usual forward order.
```
