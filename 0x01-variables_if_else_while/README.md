# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
In the C programming language, variables, if-else statements, and while loops are fundamental constructs used for data storage, decision-making, and iterative execution.

### Variables
Variables in C are used to store data values of different types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more. They provide a way to assign names to memory locations and manipulate data. 
### if-else statements
The if-else statement allows you to conditionally execute blocks of code based on certain conditions.
### While loops
The while loop enables repeated execution of a block of code as long as a condition remains true.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), without the help of Google:

### General
 - What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
 - What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
 - What the the relational operators and how to use them
 - What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
 - What are the boolean operators and how to use them
 - How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
 - How to use comments
 - How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
 - How to assign values to variables
 - How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`
 - How to use the `while` loop
 - How to use variables with the `while` loop
 - How to print variables using `printf`
 - What is the `ASCII` character set
 - What are the purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`

## Requirements
### General
 - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
 - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
 - All your files should end with a new line
 - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
 - There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
 - You are not allowed to use `system`
 - Your code should use the `Betty` style.

## Tasks
```
** Tasks 0 - Positive anything is better than negative nothing **
This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

** Tasks 1 - The last digit **
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.

** Tasks 2 - I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game **
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

** Tasks 3 - alphABET **
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

** Tasks 4 - When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off **
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

** Tasks 5 - Numbers **
Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

** Tasks 6 - Numberz **
Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

** Tasks 7 - Smile in the mirror **
Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

** Tasks 8 - Hexadecimal **
Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

** Tasks  9 -  Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success ** 

** Tasks 10 - Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need **
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

** Tasks 11 - The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do... **

** Tasks 12 - Software is eating the world **
Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
