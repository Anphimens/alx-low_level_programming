# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## Functions
In programming, functions are self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to break down a program into smaller, more manageable parts. Functions can be thought of as subprograms that can be called from other parts of the program.


## Nested loops
Nested loops are loops that are placed inside another loop. They are used when you need to perform repetitive actions in a structured and controlled manner. The outer loop controls the execution of the inner loop, and the inner loop completes all its iterations for each iteration of the outer loop

**Functions and nested loops are powerful concepts in programming that allow for code organization, reusability, and efficient execution of repetitive tasks.**

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

 - What are nested loops and how to use them
 - What is a function and how do you use functions
 - What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
 - What is a prototype
 - Scope of variables
 - What are the `gcc` flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`
 - What are header files and how to to use them with `#include`

## Requirements

### General
 - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
 - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
 - All your files should end with a new line
 - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
 - Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
 - You are not allowed to use global variables
 - No more than 5 functions per file
 - You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden
 - You are allowed to use `_putchar`
 - The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`

## Tasks

**Task 0 - isupper**

``
Write a function that checks for uppercase character.
``

**Task 1 - isdigit**

``
Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
``

**Task 2 - Collaboration is multiplication**

``Write a function that multiplies two integers.
``

**Task 3 - The numbers speak for themselves**

``
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
``

**Task 4 - I believe in numbers and signs**

``
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
``

**Task 5 - Numbers constitute the only universal language**

``
Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
``

**Task 6 - The shortest distance between two points is a straight line**

``
Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
``

**Task 7 - I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe**

``
Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
``

**Task 8 - You are so much sunshine in every square inch**

``
Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
``

**Task 9 -  Fizz-Buzz**

```
The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
```

**Task 10 - Triangles**

``
Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
``

**Task 11 -  The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic**

```
The prime factors of 1231952 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 37 and 2081.
Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.
```

**Task 12 - Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper**

``
Write a function that prints an integer.
``
